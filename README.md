# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects completed as part of coursework, research, and personal interest. Projects are organized by topic and implemented in Jupyter notebooks using libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## Classification
- `classification/mnist/` - Handwritten digit classification using a neural network (TensorFlow)

- `classification/wine-quality/` - Classifying wine quality based on physicochemical properties using a feed-forward neural network (PyTorch)

## Generative Models

- `generative-models/vae/` - Building a variational eutoencoder to generate and visualize fashion MNIST items in a 2D latent space (TensorFlow)

## Bioinformatics & Healthcare
- `bioinformatics/svm_braf_v600e_prediction/` - Predicting BRAF V600E inhibitors using Support Vector Machine (scikit-learn)

## Getting Started
Each project has its own folder and may include a `requirements.txt`. To run a notebook:

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the desired project folder
3. Install requirements (if provided)
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
