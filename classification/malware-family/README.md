# Malware Family Classification using API Call Sequences

This project uses Word2Vec and BERT embeddings combined with machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning (CNNs) to classify malware families based on API call sequences obtained through dynamic analysis.

## Notebooks

- `malware-ml.ipynb`: Embedding generation and classification with Random Forest and XGBoost
- `malware-word2vec-cnn.ipynb`: CNN model using Word2Vec embeddings
- `malware-bert-cnn.ipynb`: CNN model using BERT embeddings
- `malware-summary.ipynb`: Performance comparison and hyperparameter tuning

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was derived from a Master's thesis at San Jos√© State University (Spring 2023). It includes API call logs from 492 Windows malware samples across 7 families.

## Results

- Highest test accuracy: **90.00%** using BERT + CNN
- Best baseline: **Word2Vec + Random Forest** with **87.00%** accuracy
- Report available in `malware_report.md`
